Myself and designer Jennie Lewis helped created a new online store for Teeki. They sell a fashionable eco-conscious activewear line, which is dispatched to destinations across the globe. There was a need for a website that people could purchase their items from and their previous website did not have the functionality of an online store. They also required a website that could handle blog posts and display Instagram photos that related to their products.
