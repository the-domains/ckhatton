Hello, I'm Chris Hatton.

After graduating from an bachelor of arts in illustration, I went on to complete a bachelor of science in computing. I still illustrate, but my prime focus at the moment is creating websites and web based applications. My skills range from the use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, to programming with Ruby on Rails.
